## Dashboard Discontinuation Notice

As of **TerminusDB v11.2**, the built-in dashboard component has been **discontinued** and is no longer included with the core TerminusDB server distribution.

### Why Was the Dashboard Discontinued?

The decision to discontinue the dashboard was made to:

- **Inconsistent User Interface**: Features working correctly in the core database did not work properly in the user interface, leaving a bad impression. With significantly better alternatives now on the market (such as DFRNT), we recommend to use them instead of the built in dashboard.
- **Focus on Core Database Features**: Concentrate development efforts on the database engine, query languages (WOQL, Document API, GraphQL), and performance improvements
- **Embrace Modern Development Practices**: Encourage users to build custom interfaces using TerminusDB's powerful APIs rather than maintaining a one-size-fits-all UI
- **Reduce Maintenance Burden**: The dashboard required significant maintenance effort that could be better spent on core database functionality
- **Better Client Library Support**: Improved JavaScript and Python clients now make it easier to build custom interfaces

### Recommended Alternatives

Instead of the built-in dashboard, we recommend:

1. **Use TerminusDB Client Libraries**
   - [JavaScript Client](/docs/use-the-javascript-client/) - Build custom web interfaces with React, Vue, or vanilla JS
   - [Python Client](/docs/use-the-python-client/) - Create data management scripts and notebooks
   
2. **GraphQL Playground Tools**
   - Use [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) or [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
   - Connect directly to TerminusDB's GraphQL endpoint
   
3. **Command Line Interface**
   - Use the [TerminusDB CLI](/docs/terminusdb-cli-commands/) for database management
   - Perfect for automation and scripting

4. **DFRNT TerminusDB Cloud**
   - For a fully-featured cloud dashboard experience, consider [DFRNT TerminusDB Cloud](https://studio.dfrnt.com)
   - Includes team management, full localhost modelling experience with self-sovereign data, visual schema modeling, and data curation

## Continue Using the Dashboard (Legacy Support)

If you still need to use the legacy dashboard component, you can manually download and mount the HTML release to your TerminusDB instance.

{% callout type="warning" title="Legacy Component" %}
The dashboard is no longer maintained or supported. Security updates, bug fixes, and new features will not be provided. Use at your own risk.
{% /callout %}

### Step 1: Download the Dashboard

Download the last stable release (v6.0.10) of the dashboard:

```bash
# Download the pre-built dashboard release
curl -L https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-dashboard/releases/download/v6.0.10/release.tar.gz -o dashboard.tar.gz

# Create dashboard directory and extract the archive into it
mkdir -p dashboard
tar -xzf dashboard.tar.gz -C dashboard

# The dashboard directory now contains all the dashboard files
```

Alternatively, you can download it directly from your browser:
[https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-dashboard/releases/download/v6.0.10/release.tar.gz](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-dashboard/releases/download/v6.0.10/release.tar.gz)

{% callout type="note" title="Pre-built Release" %}
This release is already built and ready to use. No need to run npm install or build steps.
{% /callout %}

### Step 2: Mount to Docker Container

If you're running TerminusDB in Docker, mount the dashboard directory:

#### Using Docker Run

```bash
docker run -it \
  --name terminusdb \
  -p 6363:6363 \
  -v ~/dashboard:/app/terminusdb/dashboard \
  -e TERMINUSDB_DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true \
  terminusdb/terminusdb-server:v11_2_rc2
```

#### Using Docker Compose

Create or update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  terminusdb:
    image: terminusdb/terminusdb-server:v11.2
    container_name: terminusdb
    ports:
      - "6363:6363"
    volumes:
      - terminusdb_storage:/app/terminusdb/storage
      - ./dashboard:/app/terminusdb/dashboard
    environment:
      - TERMINUSDB_DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
      - TERMINUSDB_ADMIN_PASS=mypassword
volumes:
  terminusdb_storage:
```

Then start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Enable the Dashboard

The dashboard must be explicitly enabled via an environment variable:

| Environment Variable | Value | Description |
|---------------------|-------|-------------|
| `TERMINUSDB_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables the dashboard component |

Without this variable set to `true`, TerminusDB will serve a discontinuation notice instead of the dashboard.

### Step 4: Access the Dashboard

Once configured, access the dashboard at:

```
http://localhost:6363/dashboard
```

The default credentials are:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: The value set in `TERMINUSDB_ADMIN_PASS` (default: `root`)

## Directory Structure

When mounting the dashboard, ensure the following structure:

```
/app/terminusdb/dashboard/
├── index.html          # Main dashboard entry point
├── assets/            # CSS, JS, and other assets
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
└── ...                # Other dashboard files
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Discontinued" Message

**Cause**: The environment variable is not set correctly.

**Solution**: Ensure `TERMINUSDB_DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true` is set in your Docker environment.

### 404 or File Not Found Errors

**Cause**: Dashboard files are not mounted correctly.

**Solution**: 
1. Verify the dashboard files exist: `ls dashboard/index.html`
2. Check the volume mount path in Docker
3. Ensure the container can read the mounted directory

### Assets Not Loading (CSS/JS)

**Cause**: Asset paths are incorrect or files are missing.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the `assets` directory exists: `ls dashboard/assets`
2. Check browser console for specific file errors
3. Ensure the dashboard was extracted correctly from the release

### Cannot Connect to TerminusDB

**Cause**: Server is not running or port is not exposed.

**Solution**:
1. Check TerminusDB is running: `docker ps`
2. Verify port 6363 is mapped: `docker port terminusdb`
3. Check firewall settings

## Migration Path

For users migrating away from the dashboard, here's a typical workflow transition:

### Before (Using Dashboard)

1. Log in to dashboard at `http://localhost:6363/dashboard`
2. Click through UI to create databases
3. Use visual schema builder
4. Use document editor for data entry

### After (Using Client Libraries)

1. **Database Management** - Use CLI or client libraries:
   ```bash
   # CLI approach
   terminusdb db create admin/mydb
   
   # Python approach
   from terminusdb_client import Client
   client = Client("http://localhost:6363")
   client.connect(user="admin", password="root")
   client.create_database("mydb")
   ```

2. **Schema Definition** - Define schema in code:
   ```python
   # Python schema definition
   from terminusdb_client.woqlschema import WOQLSchema, DocumentTemplate
   
   schema = WOQLSchema()
   
   class Person(DocumentTemplate):
       _schema = schema
       name: str
       age: int
   
   client.insert_document(schema.to_dict())
   ```

3. **Data Operations** - Use GraphQL or Document API:
   ```python
   # Insert documents
   client.insert_document({
       "@type": "Person",
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 30
   })
   
   # Query with GraphQL
   result = client.query_document({
       "type": "Person",
       "query": {"age": {"@gt": 25}}
   })
   ```
