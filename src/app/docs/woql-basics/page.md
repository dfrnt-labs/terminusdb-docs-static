WOQL (Web Object Query Language) is TerminusDB's Datalog-based query language. It finds patterns across documents and their relationships by declaring what you want — not how to get it. Unlike SQL, WOQL traverses document links natively without JOINs. Unlike GraphQL (which TerminusDB also supports), WOQL handles complex pattern matching, recursive traversal, aggregation, and data transformation in a single composable query.

Not sure which query interface to use? See [Choosing a Query Interface](/docs/querying-terminusdb) for a comparison of WOQL, GraphQL, and the HTTP Document API.

## Your first WOQL query

WOQL queries are composed of variables, triple patterns, and combinators. Let's start with a simple query that looks at one field.

We need to describe which variables we want to use, and we do that with `Vars`.

Next we add the `limit` word, to limit to 10 entries.

Then we complete the query with a `triple` word, using the `source` variable, the `label` field, and the `destination` variable.

```javascript
let v = Vars("source", "destination");
limit(10).triple(v.source, 'label', v.destination)
```

The results will come back in a table below in the UI. In the client it will return as a list of JSON objects, having each of the variables described in `Vars` bound.

The `destination` variable is filled with elements of type _string_, because `label` always terminates in a string. However we can also add other fields to our object, to search for more information by chaining `triple` together.

```javascript
let v = Vars("person", "eyes", "name");
limit(5)
  .triple(v.person, 'label', v.name)
  .triple(v.person, 'eye_color', v.eyes)
```

This query results in the following:

{% table %}

- Name
- Eyes
- Person

---

- Luke Skywalker
- blue
- People/1

--- 

- Obi-Wan Kenobi
- blue-gray
- People/10

---

- Anakin Skywalker
- blue
- People/11

---

- Wilhuff Tarkin
- blue
- People/12

---

- Chewbacca
- blue
- People/13

{% /table %}

## and

The `.` syntax is actually introducing an implicit `and` between `triple` words. We can rewrite our query above as:

```javascript
let v = Vars("person", "eyes", "name");
limit(5)
  .and(triple(v.person, 'label', v.name),
       triple(v.person, 'eye_color', v.eyes))
```

## select

Since we probably do not really need the `person` variable, as it is an id, and we are just using it to make sure we are talking about the _same_ person in both triples, we can use `select` to remove it.

```javascript
let v = Vars("person", "eyes", "name");
limit(5)
  .select(v.name, v.eyes)
  .and(triple(v.person, 'label', v.name),
       triple(v.person, 'eye_color', v.eyes))
```

Now we get back the table with the `person` column removed.
