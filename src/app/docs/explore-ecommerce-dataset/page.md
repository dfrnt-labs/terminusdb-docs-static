Clone a pre-populated ecommerce database to your local TerminusDB instance, query orders across customers and products, update an order status on a branch, and see a field-level structural diff — in 15 minutes. New to TerminusDB? Do the [First 10 Minutes quickstart](/docs/get-started/) first — it teaches the branch/diff/merge workflow this tutorial builds on.

## What you will build

You will clone a complete ecommerce database (customers, orders, order lines, products, categories) from a public server, run a query that traverses document relationships without JOINs, create a business-scenario branch ("fulfil an order"), and see a field-level structural diff of the change.

**The dataset:**

| Document type | Count | Key relationships |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| Category | 6 | Hierarchical (parent → child) |
| Product | 20 | Belongs to Category |
| Customer | 15 | — |
| Order | 30 | Placed by Customer |
| OrderLine | 84 | Belongs to Order, references Product |

**Relationship graph:** Customer ← Order ← OrderLine → Product → Category

## Step 1 — Clone the ecommerce database {% step %}

Pull the entire ecommerce dataset from the public templates server to your local instance — one POST is all it takes. `Authorization-Remote` carries the public server's anonymous credentials (`public:public`):

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/clone/admin/ecommerce" headers="{\"Authorization-Remote\": \"Basic cHVibGljOnB1YmxpYw==\"}" %}
```json
{"remote_url": "https://data.terminusdb.org/public/ecommerce", "label": "ecommerce", "comment": "Cloned ecommerce from data.terminusdb.org"}
```
{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:CloneResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

You just pulled ~155 documents — customers, orders, products, and their relationships — from a public TerminusDB server to your local instance. The data is now yours to query, branch, and modify. If the database already exists locally, the server answers `api:DatabaseAlreadyExists` — that's fine, you're ready.

## Step 2 — List the document types {% step %}

List the document types defined in the schema:

{% http-example method="GET" path="/api/document/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/main?graph_type=schema&as_list=true&skip=1" /%}

{% http-expected %}
[{"@id":"OrderLine","@key":{"@fields":["order_line_id"],"@type":"Lexical"},"@type":"Class","order":"Order","order_line_id":"xsd:string","product":"Product","quantity":"xsd:integer","unit_price":"xsd:decimal"},{"@id":"Product","@key":{"@fields":["name"],"@type":"Lexical"},"@type":"Class","category":"Category","description":{"@class":"xsd:string","@type":"Optional"},"in_stock":"xsd:boolean","name":"xsd:string","price":"xsd:decimal"},{"@id":"Category","@key":{"@fields":["name"],"@type":"Lexical"},"@type":"Class","name":"xsd:string","parent_category":{"@class":"Category","@type":"Optional"}},{"@id":"Customer","@key":{"@fields":["email"],"@type":"Lexical"},"@type":"Class","country":"xsd:string","email":"xsd:string","name":"xsd:string","registered_date":"xsd:date"},{"@id":"Order","@key":{"@fields":["order_id"],"@type":"Lexical"},"@type":"Class","customer":"Customer","order_date":"xsd:dateTime","order_id":"xsd:string","status":"xsd:string","total":"xsd:decimal"}]
{% /http-expected %}

The response lists 5 document types — `Category`, `Customer`, `Order`, `OrderLine`, and `Product`.

## Step 3 — List the orders {% step %}

List the first five orders (of 30 total):

{% http-example method="GET" path="/api/document/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/main?type=Order&count=5&as_list=true" /%}

{% http-expected %}
[{"@id":"Order/ORD-0001","@type":"Order","customer":"Customer/alice.smith@example.com","order_date":"2025-06-20T19:37:13.014Z","order_id":"ORD-0001","status":"delivered","total":989.97},{"@id":"Order/ORD-0002","@type":"Order","customer":"Customer/hana.tanaka@example.com","order_date":"2024-03-19T03:10:07.294Z","order_id":"ORD-0002","status":"processing","total":5235.93},{"@id":"Order/ORD-0003","@type":"Order","customer":"Customer/ivan.petrov@example.com","order_date":"2025-06-21T23:34:22.359Z","order_id":"ORD-0003","status":"delivered","total":259.97},{"@id":"Order/ORD-0004","@type":"Order","customer":"Customer/hana.tanaka@example.com","order_date":"2024-06-19T09:28:47.644Z","order_id":"ORD-0004","status":"delivered","total":5828.94},{"@id":"Order/ORD-0005","@type":"Order","customer":"Customer/ivan.petrov@example.com","order_date":"2025-03-31T03:56:59.165Z","order_id":"ORD-0005","status":"delivered","total":2559.95}]
{% /http-expected %}

The database holds 30 orders plus 15 customers, 20 products, and 84 order lines — all interconnected, all versioned. Order totals are stored as `xsd:decimal` — arbitrary-precision exact arithmetic, not floating-point. Financial figures stay exact across every query, branch, and diff.

## Step 4 — Query: find processing orders with customer details {% step %}

Show all orders still in "processing" status, with the customer's name and country.

In a relational database, this requires a JOIN: `SELECT o.order_id, o.total, c.name, c.country FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id WHERE o.status = 'processing'`. You declare the relationship in the query because the database does not know it intrinsically. In TerminusDB, an Order document has a `customer` field that *is* the link to a Customer document — you simply follow it:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/woql/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/main" %}
{% http-woql %}
import TerminusClient from "@terminusdb/terminusdb-client";

const client = new TerminusClient.WOQLClient("http://localhost:6363", {
  user: "admin",
  organization: "admin",
  key: "root",
});
client.db("ecommerce");

const WOQL = TerminusClient.WOQL;
const query = WOQL.and(
  WOQL.triple("v:Order", "status", WOQL.string("processing")),
  WOQL.triple("v:Order", "order_id", "v:OrderId"),
  WOQL.triple("v:Order", "total", "v:Total"),
  WOQL.triple("v:Order", "customer", "v:Customer"),
  WOQL.triple("v:Customer", "name", "v:CustomerName"),
  WOQL.triple("v:Customer", "country", "v:Country")
);

const result = await client.query(query);
console.log(result.bindings);
{% /http-woql %}
```json
{"query": {"@type": "And", "and": [{"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Order"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "status"}, "object": {"@type": "DataValue", "data": "processing"}}, {"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Order"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "order_id"}, "object": {"@type": "DataValue", "variable": "OrderId"}}, {"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Order"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "total"}, "object": {"@type": "DataValue", "variable": "Total"}}, {"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Order"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "customer"}, "object": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Customer"}}, {"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Customer"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "name"}, "object": {"@type": "DataValue", "variable": "CustomerName"}}, {"@type": "Triple", "subject": {"@type": "NodeValue", "variable": "Customer"}, "predicate": {"@type": "NodeValue", "node": "country"}, "object": {"@type": "DataValue", "variable": "Country"}}]}}
```
{% http-expected %}
[{"OrderId": "ORD-0002", "Total": 5235.93, "CustomerName": "Hana Tanaka", "Country": "Japan"}, {"OrderId": "ORD-0019", "Total": 1094.95, "CustomerName": "Leila Okafor", "Country": "Nigeria"}, {"OrderId": "ORD-0030", "Total": 649.91, "CustomerName": "Erik Lindström", "Country": "Sweden"}]
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

You just traversed Order → Customer in a single query — no JOIN syntax, no ON clause, no foreign key declaration. TerminusDB follows document links natively. The `customer` field in Order *is* the link; the query simply walks it.

## Step 5 — Create a fulfillment branch {% step %}

A processing order has been shipped. Update its status on a branch called `fulfillment`:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/branch/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/fulfillment" %}
{"origin": "admin/ecommerce/local/branch/main"}
{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:BranchResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

## Step 6 — Ship the order on the branch {% step %}

Update order ORD-0002 to "shipped" on the branch:

{% http-example method="PUT" path="/api/document/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/fulfillment?author=warehouse@example.com&message=Ship+order+ORD-0002" %}
{"@id": "Order/ORD-0002", "@type": "Order", "order_id": "ORD-0002", "customer": "Customer/hana.tanaka@example.com", "order_date": "2024-03-19T03:10:07.294Z", "status": "shipped", "total": 5235.93}
{% http-expected %}
["Order/ORD-0002"]
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

You just updated one field — `status` from "processing" to "shipped" — on an isolated branch. Main still has the original state. Let's see exactly what changed.

## Step 7 — See what changed (the diff) {% step %}

In any other database, answering "what exactly changed in this order?" means querying an audit table, parsing CDC events, or comparing snapshots you exported. In TerminusDB, you ask the database directly — compare your `fulfillment` branch against `main`:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/diff/admin/ecommerce" %}
{"before_data_version": "main", "after_data_version": "fulfillment"}
{% http-expected %}
[{"@id": "Order/ORD-0002", "status": {"@op": "SwapValue", "@before": "processing", "@after": "shipped"}}]
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

One field changed. TerminusDB knows it was `status`, knows the old value ("processing") and the new value ("shipped"), and confirms nothing else was touched — not the customer reference, not the total, not the order date. This is **structural, not textual** — the database understands the document schema and reports typed operations (`SwapValue`), not line diffs.

This is your audit trail — automatic, precise, and queryable. No trigger tables writing to a separate audit schema. No CDC pipeline capturing change events. No application-level event sourcing. The database *is* the changelog, and this diff can be applied, reversed, or forwarded to any system that needs to know what happened.

## Step 8 — Merge back to main {% step %}

When you are satisfied with the change, merge the fulfillment branch back:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/apply/admin/ecommerce/local/branch/main" %}
{"before_commit": "main", "after_commit": "fulfillment", "commit_info": {"author": "warehouse@example.com", "message": "Merge fulfillment into main"}}
{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:ApplyResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

The order status change is now on main. The branch remains as a record of who changed what and when.

---

## Step 9 — Clean up {% step %}

This deletes the **ecommerce** data product permanently — only run it when you are finished experimenting:

{% http-example method="DELETE" path="/api/db/admin/ecommerce" confirm="This will permanently delete the ecommerce data product." /%}

{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:DbDeleteResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}

## What you just did

In 15 minutes, you:

1. **Cloned** a complete ecommerce database from a public server — one command, no account
2. **Queried** relationships across documents (orders to customers) without JOINs
3. **Branched** the database, updated an order status (a real business scenario)
4. **Diffed** the branch against main and saw a single field-level change
5. **Merged** the change back to main — completing the workflow

These operations — clone, query, branch, diff, merge — are the core of TerminusDB. Every operation you just ran works at any scale: 155 documents or 1.5 million.
