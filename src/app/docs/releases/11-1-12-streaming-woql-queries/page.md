TerminusDB 11.1.12 makes the WOQL endpoint stream query results and adds libraries of reusable parametric queries. Released on **13 March 2024**, it is the last feature release of the 11 line before the 12 series.

- [**Streaming WOQL results**](#streaming-woql-results) — results arrive as they are produced.
- [**Parametric query library**](#parametric-query-library) — reference reusable queries inside complex ones.
- [**Collection resources**](#collection-resources) — graph endpoints take ordinary collection paths.

## Streaming WOQL results

### What it does

The WOQL endpoint can now return streaming data — results are sent as they are computed instead of being buffered into one response. (The release notes flag this as not yet documented; see the endpoint reference for current behaviour.)

### Why it matters

TODO(human): why it matters

**Read more:** [WOQL query streaming](/docs/woql-query-streaming/) · [Run a WOQL query](/docs/run-woql-query/)

## Parametric query library

The WOQL endpoint accepts a **library of parametric queries** in the request — named, reusable query templates that a complex query can invoke, instead of inlining the same logic repeatedly.

**Read more:** [NamedParametricQuery](/docs/woql-class-reference-guide/#namedparametricquery) · [NamedQuery](/docs/woql-class-reference-guide/#namedquery)

## Collection resources

Endpoints that take a graph resource now also accept ordinary collection resources, optionally followed by `/schema` or `/instance` (instance is the default) — so URLs like `admin/db` work where `admin/db/local/branch/main` used to be required.

## Also in 11.1.12

- Initial support for building with SWI-Prolog 9.2
- Query optimization changed to opt-in and is disabled by default

## Fixes

- Internal WOQL graph no longer recreated at every startup
- Looking up a single missing document no longer errors
- WOQL Dictionary templates work when only partially filled
- Fixed delta-rollup dictionary translation panics during deletion

## Upgrade

```bash
docker pull terminusdb/terminusdb-server:v11.1.12
```
