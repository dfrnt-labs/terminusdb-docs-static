TerminusDB is a [versatile graph database](/docs/terminusdb-explanation/) for [model-based hierarchically structured records](/docs/documents-explanation/), designed as a [flexible headless content management system](/docs/document-graph-api/).

It offers both [model-based JSON](/docs/schema-reference-guide/), [logical reasoning](/docs/woql-explanation/) and [RDF graphs](/docs/graphs-explanation/) in one package with [git-for-data](/docs/git-for-data-reference/) and [immutable history](/docs/graphs-explanation/) built in. 

Technical and linked data professionals need a solution for [complex content](/docs/python-woql-customer-data-processing-example/), [taxonomy/knowledge handling](/docs/cookbook-taxonomy-inheritance/) and [collaborative semantic infrastructure](/docs/branch-a-project/). Existing solutions don't have the comprehensive set of features required to handle complex content, taxonomyies and ontologies, nor do they provide collaborative semantic infrastructure with easy commit, roll-back and non-destructive branches for both schema and content.

If you are contemplating building a rules engine or configurator in prolog, try TerminusDB!

Where [logic reasoning on information models](/docs/woql-basics/) for the facts prolog becomes too complex to handle, TerminusDB offers the perfect balance as a [rules-engine for complex document-oriented graphs](/docs/path-queries-in-woql/) with a modelling environment.

It is a [graph database with ACID transactions](/docs/acid-transactions-explanation/), with [full immutable history](/docs/immutability-explanation/), a [very advanced type model](/docs/schema-reference-guide/) with inheritance, [schema migration](/docs/schema-migration-reference-guide/), and [XML Datatypes for its data structures](/docs/terminuscms-data-types/), [git-for-data (including push, pull clone and branching)](/docs/git-for-data-reference/), and plays well with others using both [REST (OpenAPI Reference)](/docs/openapi/), the [WOQL datalog query language](/docs/woql-explanation/) for both read and write and a [Rust-based high performance GraphQL Engine](/docs/graphql-query-reference/).

TerminusDB is an open source platform maintained by [DFRNT®](https://dfrnt.com?utm_source=terminusdb&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=terminusdb_docs_at_a_glance) in collaboration with the community, sitting at the convergence of content, logic and graphs.

### Complete User Interface

The [DFRNT Studio for TerminusDB](https://dfrnt.com/hypergraph-content-studio/) offers a commercially packaged solution, with hosting API tokens and collaborative environments, modelling environment and document UI that help you go from idea to prototype and production in a few hours or a few days.
