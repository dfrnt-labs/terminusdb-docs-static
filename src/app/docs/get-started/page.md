TerminusDB is a database built for collaboration. In this quickstart you will clone a pre-populated dataset and immediately use the git-for-data workflow: branch, edit, diff, and merge. No schema to write, no data to invent.

{% callout title="Prerequisites" %}
You need **Docker** installed and running. Nothing else — no npm, no pip, no SDK.
{% /callout %}

## Step 1 — Start TerminusDB

Pull and run TerminusDB in one command:

```bash
docker run --pull always -d -p 127.0.0.1:6363:6363 \
  -v terminusdb_storage:/app/terminusdb/storage \
  --name terminusdb terminusdb/terminusdb-server:v12
```

Wait a few seconds for the server to start, then confirm it is running:

{% http-example method="GET" path="/api/info" /%}

You should see a JSON response with `"authority": "admin"` confirming the server is ready.

{% callout type="warning" title="Not working?" %}
If the command hangs or returns a connection error: Docker may not be running, port 6363 may already be in use, or a previous container named `terminusdb` may already exist. See [Troubleshooting Connection Failures](/docs/troubleshooting-connection) and [Authentication Errors](/docs/troubleshooting-auth) for solutions.
{% /callout %}

## Step 2 — Clone a ready-made dataset

Skip the manual database creation and start with real data immediately:

{% quickstart-clone /%}

You now have a fully populated Star Wars database ready to explore — documents, relationships, and commit history. Use it to try the full git-for-data workflow: what would have changed if Anakin Skywalker had turned to the Dark Side?

## Step 3 — Create a branch

Create a `what-if` branch to experiment without affecting the original data:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/branch/admin/star-wars/local/branch/what-if" %}
{"origin": "admin/star-wars/local/branch/main"}
{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:BranchResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

You now have two branches: `main` (the cloned data, unchanged) and `what-if` (a copy, ready for edits).

## Step 4 — Edit on the branch

Pose a "what if" — change Anakin Skywalker's allegiance on the `what-if` branch:

{% http-example method="PUT" path="/api/document/admin/star-wars/local/branch/what-if?author=admin&message=What+if+Anakin+turned" %}
{"@type": "Person", "@id": "Person/Anakin%20Skywalker", "name": "Anakin Skywalker", "height": 188, "mass": 84, "hair_color": "blond", "eye_color": "yellow", "birth_year": "41.9BBY", "gender": "male", "side": "Dark Side", "faction": "Sith", "quote": "This is where the fun begins.", "homeworld": "terminusdb:///data/Planet/Tatooine", "films": ["terminusdb:///data/Film/The%20Phantom%20Menace", "terminusdb:///data/Film/Attack%20of%20the%20Clones", "terminusdb:///data/Film/Revenge%20of%20the%20Sith"], "species": ["terminusdb:///data/Species/Human"]}
{% http-expected %}
["terminusdb:///data/Person/Anakin%20Skywalker"]
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

The edit lives only on `what-if`. On `main`, Anakin is still Light Side.

## Step 5 — Diff the branches

This is the moment. See exactly what changed between `main` and `what-if`:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/diff/admin/star-wars" %}
{"before_data_version": "main", "after_data_version": "what-if"}
{% http-expected %}
[{"@id": "Person/Anakin%20Skywalker", "eye_color": {"@op": "SwapValue", "@before": "blue", "@after": "yellow"}, "faction": {"@op": "SwapValue", "@before": "Jedi Order", "@after": "Sith"}, "side": {"@op": "SwapValue", "@before": "Light Side", "@after": "Dark Side"}}]
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

{% callout title="What just happened?" %}
TerminusDB computed a **structural diff** between two branches. This is not a line-by-line text diff — it is a semantic patch that knows exactly which fields changed, what the old values were, and what the new values are. Each change is a `SwapValue` operation that can be applied, reversed, or composed with other patches.

Three fields changed: `side`, `faction`, and `eye_color`. TerminusDB detected all three independently — no manual tracking, no event sourcing, no change-data-capture pipeline. The database does it natively.
{% /callout %}

## Step 6 — Merge the branch

Apply the changes from `what-if` back to `main`:

{% http-example method="POST" path="/api/apply/admin/star-wars/local/branch/main" %}
{"before_commit": "main", "after_commit": "what-if", "commit_info": {"author": "admin", "message": "Merge what-if: Anakin turns to the Dark Side"}}
{% http-expected %}
{"@type":"api:ApplyResponse","api:status":"api:success"}
{% /http-expected %}
{% /http-example %}

Done. The `main` branch now reflects the "what if" scenario — Anakin is on the Dark Side.

## What you just did

In 6 steps you used the full git-for-data workflow:

| Step | Git equivalent | TerminusDB API |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Clone dataset | `git clone` | `POST /api/clone` |
| Create branch | `git branch` | `POST /api/branch` |
| Edit on branch | commit on branch | `PUT /api/document` |
| Diff branches | `git diff main..what-if` | `POST /api/diff/{org}/{db}` with `before_data_version` / `after_data_version` |
| Merge | `git merge --squash` | `POST /api/apply` with `before_commit` / `after_commit` |

## Step 7 — Clean up

Delete the cloned database when you are done experimenting:

{% http-example method="DELETE" path="/api/db/admin/star-wars" runnable=false /%}

To stop TerminusDB entirely:

```bash
docker stop terminusdb && docker rm terminusdb
```

Your data persists in the `terminusdb_storage` Docker volume. To remove it entirely: `docker volume rm terminusdb_storage`.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Connection refused

**You see:**
```text
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 6363 after 0 ms: Connection refused
```

**Cause:** TerminusDB is not running, or another process is using port 6363.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if the container is running
docker ps | grep terminusdb

# If not running, start it
docker start terminusdb

# If it doesn't exist, create it
docker run -d --name terminusdb -p 127.0.0.1:6363:6363 \
  -v terminusdb_storage:/app/terminusdb/storage \
  terminusdb/terminusdb-server
```

### Error: 401 Unauthorized

**You see:**
```json
{"@type":"api:ErrorResponse","api:error":{"@type":"api:IncorrectAuthenticationError"},"api:status":"api:failure"}
```

**Cause:** Wrong username or password. The default local credentials are `admin` / `root`.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify credentials work
curl -u admin:root http://localhost:6363/api/info
```

If you set a custom password via `TERMINUSDB_ADMIN_PASS` when creating the container, use that value instead of `root`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to define a schema before inserting data?

**A:** No. Using `?raw_json=true` on the document endpoint lets you insert any valid JSON without a schema. TerminusDB stores it as-is. When you are ready for type safety, add a schema later — TerminusDB will validate all future inserts against it. See [Schema Reference](/docs/schema-reference-guide/) for details.

### Q: Can I use TerminusDB without Docker?

**A:** Yes. You can [build from source](/docs/install-terminusdb-from-source-code/) on Linux or macOS, or run on [Kubernetes](/docs/install-on-kubernetes/). Docker is the recommended path because it requires no dependencies and works on all platforms, but it is not the only option.

### Q: How do I reset and start fresh?

**A:** Stop and remove the container (`docker stop terminusdb && docker rm terminusdb`), then remove the storage volume (`docker volume rm terminusdb_storage`). Restart with the original `docker run` command. This gives you a clean instance with no databases.
